# House Price Prediction
## Overview 
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and median income of the area. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is the California housing dataset, which contains information about houses in California. It includes features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle. Here's the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction/input?select=housing.csv)

Also you can find the dataset in the repository as well.

## Requirements 
To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Methodology 

1. __Data Collection :__ Obtain a dataset containing housing information, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and median income of the area.

2. __Data Preprocessing :__ Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if needed.

3. __Feature Selection :__ Select relevant features that have the most impact on house prices.

4. __Model Selection :__ Choose a regression model to predict house prices.
* Common models include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.

5. __Model Training :__ Train the selected model using the training dataset.

6. __Model Evaluation :__ Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset and metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Results 

Visualize the results of the model using scatter plots of predicted vs. actual house prices.
