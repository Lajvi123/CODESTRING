# House Price Prediction
## Overview 
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and median income of the area. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is the California housing dataset, which contains information about houses in California. It includes features such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle. Here's the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/bayesian-regression-house-price-prediction/input?select=housing.csv)

Also you can find the dataset in the repository as well.

## Requirements
